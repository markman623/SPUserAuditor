SPUserAuditor
=============

A tool for gathering screenshots of User groups in SharePoint.

IE is required for the tool to run.

Still in Alpha phase and needs more work but runs.

Todos:

1.  Elliminate browser objects from code (if possible).
2.  Force screen shot to to be from 'modern' browser, currently using an ie8 and does not support all HTML5 features
3.  Browser/screenshot size should be more consistant.
4.  Could add further devling into non-inheritant permissions on child items.
5.  Audit list, confirming the same as screen shots 
6.  Powershell cmdlet to allow for scripting.
7.  Follow Model-View-ViewModel for tool.
